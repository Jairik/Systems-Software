--- Memory Layout of a C Program (C Program is comprised of 5 components) ---
OVERVIEW: Text Segment, Initialized Data Segment, Uninitualized Data Segment, Stack, Heap

Text Segment: The machine instruction sets. Only one copy needs to be in the memory since it might be shared.

Initialized Data Segment: Variables that are initialized in the program (ex: int i = 0)

Uninitialized Data Segment (bss): Variables that are not initialized

Stack: Saved temporary variables when a function is called. Also saves the caller's environment values such as return address.

Heap: Used for dynamic memory allocation
