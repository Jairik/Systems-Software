-- What is a pipe? --

A pipe is used to communicate between a parent & child process or two sibling processes. In the context of linux, pipes are a half duplex (data flows in only one direction).

#include <unistd.h>
int pipe(int filedes[2]);

Two file descriptors are returned through the filedes[] arguments:
	- filedes[0] is open for READING
	- filedes[1] is open for WRITING
