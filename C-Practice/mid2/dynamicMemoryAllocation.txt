--- Dynamic Memory Allocation ---
There are three functions for memory allocation by C (located in Heap):

void *malloc(size_t size); (size = size of memory block in bytes)
Allocates a specified number of bytes of memory. Initial value of memory is indeterminate.

void *calloc(size_t nitems, size_t size); (size = ^, nitem = number of elements to be allocated)
Allocates space for a specified number of objects of a specified size. The space is initialized to all 0 bits.

void *realloc(void *ptr, size_t size);  (size = New size of memory block, in bytes. ptr = ptr to old memory block previously allocated)
Changes the size of a previously allocated area

free(void *ptr);  
Deallocates the space pointed to by ptr

--- All functions return the pointer to the allocated memory ---
