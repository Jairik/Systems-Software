-- What are pthread cleanup functions? --
Covers pthread_cleanup_push() and pthread_cleanup_pop()

--> pthread_cleanup_push

#include <pthread.h>
void pthread_cleanup_push(void (*routine)(void *), void *arg);

This pushes a clean up function routine, which is to be called with arg when the thread performs:
	- pthread_exit()
	- pthread_cancel()

Thus, when either of these are called, the functions associated with pthread_cleanup_push is called.

--> pthread_cleanup_pop

#include <pthread.h>
void pthread_cleanup_pop(int execute);

Every pthread_cleanup_push MUST be associated with a pthread_cleanup_pop, since they form a stack of cleanup handlers. pthread_cleanup_pop removes the last cleanup handler from the stack (LIFO), optionally executing it if execute == 1 (else, it will not execute and just remove it).
