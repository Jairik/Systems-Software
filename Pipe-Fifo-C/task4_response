--- Task 4 Response - Making the Fifo ---

In order to make the Fifo, I used the following command(s):
	mkfifo /tmp/task4_fifo  <-- Making the Fifo file
	chmod a+rwx /tmp/task4_fifo   <-- Assigning it with the appropriate permissions

Alternatively, I could have done this within the C program by using the mkfifo(path, permissions) system call within the C program.
