-------------------------- Task 4 Response - How is this result different than task 3? --------------------------

By using the wait function, the parent will not start it's iterations until the child process is done. Therefore,
the child will be printed Nc times, then the parents will be printed Np times. This is different than task 3, where
the processes iterated concurrently.
